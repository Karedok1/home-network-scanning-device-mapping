# Home Network Scanning & Device Mapping (Beginner-Friendly)

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple, ethical, and beginner-friendly approach to identifying devices connected to a home network.
The goal is to improve visibility, security awareness, and basic network hygiene for non-technical users.

This project is part of **KaredokNet**, an independent initiative focused on practical WiFi and home network security.

## Environment
- Network type: Home / Lab network
- Scope: Local subnet only (192.168.1.0/24)
- Authorization: Network owned and managed by me
- OS: Linux

---

## Tools Used
- Nmap

---

## What Was Done
- Identified the active network interface and subnet
- Performed host discovery to list active devices
- Conducted a light service scan on the router (non-intrusive)
- Classified devices based on role and behavior
- Interpreted risks using clear, human-readable explanations

---

## Key Findings
- Multiple active devices were identified on the local network
- The router exposed several common services (FTP, HTTP, SMB)
- Some services may be unnecessary in a home environment
- Device visibility helps reduce unknown or unmanaged risks

---

## Risk Interpretation (Plain Language)
- **FTP (Port 21)**  
  Legacy service that is not encrypted. If unused, it increases unnecessary exposure.

- **HTTP (Port 80)**  
  Indicates an unencrypted management interface. Credentials may be exposed on local networks.

- **SMB (Port 445)**  
  Common in LAN environments but should never be exposed beyond the local network.

---

## Recommendations
- Disable unused router services (e.g., FTP)
- Use HTTPS for router management if available
- Regularly review connected devices
- Isolate IoT devices when possible
- Keep router firmware up to date

---

## Screenshots
Sensitive IP addresses and identifiers have been anonymized.

---

## Ethical Note
All scanning activities were performed on a network I own or manage.
No intrusive, aggressive, or illegal actions were conducted.
This project focuses on awareness, visibility, and basic security hygiene.
